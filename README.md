- AI opponent that uses the **minimax algorithm** to make optimal moves.
- Option to play as either 'X' or 'O', with the AI always playing as the opponent.
- Clean, easy-to-use interface with a simple layout.

## Tech Stack:
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: **Swing** (part of Java's standard library)
